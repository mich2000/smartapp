# Smartapp project

This is a full-stack application made by using React as a frontend and Rust for the backend api. The app will help you to manage your food by defining storage units (ex. fridge, freezer, ..) and putting your food into it. One of the things that the app will serve for is to reduce food waste by tracking the expiration date of the food.

## Different folders

* backend: Contains the library and executable rust projects for the api. The necessary dockerfiles are also present.
